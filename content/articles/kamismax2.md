bodyText: This is a project back in 2006 or 2007 - can't remember the year exactly that I did at Indiana University as a Telecommunications (now Media School) major, in promoting the career fair. The videos were in stock for students to use, and we had to create a convincing video for students to attend the event, and only 7-8 are chosen to have their videos broadcasted.  <br>And luckily, my video was chosen as one of them.  <br> A fun fact, I used my own music composition as a background.
