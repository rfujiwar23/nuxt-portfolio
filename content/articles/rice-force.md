bodyText: My directorial debut because of the opportunity arised when the director went into a month long surgery and recovery time. I was working as an assistant director, but the director had confidence in me that I could direct and produce the video based on my rep. Though the meetings were already happening before I got the immediate call to the role, I took the responsibility of the floor director with the producer.  And from creating the posters (which was basically 25% of my job as an assistant director) and editing the video both online and offline, I got a praise from the client of my skills and also them wanting to use the poster that I created in their events.  From my design skills, I was able to design the landing (main) page of the company's website - which got me to develop web skills onward.
