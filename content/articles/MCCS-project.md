bodyText: I've created videos prior to this, but this is one of two videos that I created as a Telecommunications major in college that was used by a client, Monroe County Community Schools in Bloomington, Indiana, as part of the class project, and it is a unique experience not only did it involve the client, but because it was only my partner and myself being able to create the video for the client, unlike the others that did their projects on their own.  <br> Even though sales is not my forte, this is the initial reason why I love planning aspect of the production, whether it be for video or web - as I gained the skills in project planning and with the producurial role.
