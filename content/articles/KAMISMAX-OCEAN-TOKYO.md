bodyText: Part from the app, KAMISMAX, which is an educational streaming app for the stylists in Japan.  It is like Netflix in terms of design and concept. I was part of the producer/directorial role with this project, in creating the storyboard ahd working with the filming crew to shoot at Team Lab in Tokyo.   This video is to show the entertainment aspect of the stylist, Takuya Takagi, promoting his 'up-to-trend' style ,and making perspective stylists garnering interest.
