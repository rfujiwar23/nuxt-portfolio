title: Nature Index Supplements - Nature Index 2025 Science Inc.
description: UIUX and partial Product Management role
bodyText: <strong>ABOUT</strong><br>From seeing the user journey map on GA4, figured that user journey on Nature Index supplements page, which is a collection of articles in particular researches (Cancer, Neuroscience, Science - in general), the visitors would usually divert to another page, not particularly the article within the topic. Also, though Nature Index is one of the main pages in the Nature website, the SEO of the supplement pages weren't performing well. By having article title in URL, the search result on Google would improve. <br><br><strong>The Process/Issues</strong><br>Could have created the CMS to allow more interactive page to happen, but because we already had used Foleon for another service within Nature Index (Nature Research Reports - which is sold to researchers), it was appropriate to use Foleon to create the website. Researching many pages built with Foleon with the help from Foleon Sales' Support Team, used box-based article listing, and also be able to use the article title in the URL to allow better search engine result. By creating this page, it increased traffic for the month of June (the release of the supplement page) upto 36%, nearly 20% increase from previous month.
