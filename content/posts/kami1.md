description: <strong>ABOUT</strong><br>From seeing the user journey map on GA4, figured that user journey on Nature Index supplements page, which is a collection of articles in particular researches (Cancer, Neuroscience, Science - in general), the visitors would usually divert to another page, not particularly the article within the topic. Also, though Nature Index is one of the main pages in the Nature website, the SEO of the supplement pages weren't performing well. By having article title in URL, the search result on Google would improve. <br><br>
