title: Grand Prix Site- Web Design / Web App
description: This is a tournament, a Grand Prix, for aspiring young/fresh stylists in Japan to be certified as a K.C. stylist, a high honor like getting noticed in Michelin Guide.  
bodyText: This is just currently a landing page only, while a full app is being created at this moment, as I have done the UIUX design and also taking the role of a front-end developer.  In taking the concept of M-1 Grand Prix (a famous MANZAI competition that is done annually for comedians), this event is for stylists who want to be certified as a K.C. stylist by posting their creative video of why one (or a group) is so special.  Every design in this website and also the app is the 'easy-to-understand' design since many stylists and beauticians in Japan lack skills in PCs or technical terms.
