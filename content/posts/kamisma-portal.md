title: Portal Site - Web Design (App In Progress)
description: A Portal Site
bodyText: <strong>ABOUT</strong><br>Although KAMI CHARISMA stylists are featured annually in the prestigious KAMI CHARISMA book—and some have even reached celebrity-level recognition within Japan—the brand itself was still relatively unknown to the general public. Additionally, because the KAMI CHARISMA ecosystem consisted of three separate websites (www.kami-charisma.com, beauty.kamisma.com, and kamismax.kamisma.com/service1/), user navigation was fragmented. Based on insights gathered from Google Analytics, it became clear that we needed to create a centralized portal site to streamline the user journey and strengthen the brand experience across all touchpoints.<br>This project came with a tight deadline—less than one month—and had to be planned and executed on short notice. Even though the broader web development team had recently expanded with an offshore team working on the KAMISMAX app, I stepped into the leadership role and took full ownership of developing the portal site from the ground up. After evaluating the requirements and timeframe, building the site in WordPress was the most efficient and scalable solution.<br>In this project, I worked as a WordPress Developer, Front-End Developer, and Web Designer, handling everything from site architecture, theme customization, and UI layout to responsive front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built custom filters to allow users—particularly sales and internal teams—to sort stylists based on their professional “star” level. Throughout the development process, I continuously shared test links with the sales team to validate usability, refine interactions, and ensure the filtering experience aligned with real user needs.<br>Ultimately, this project showcased not only my technical capabilities across WordPress and front-end development, but also my strengths in project leadership, time management, and rapid delivery under tight deadlines. Despite the short timeline, I completed the site in three weeks, successfully launching a functional, user-centered portal that unified the KAMI CHARISMA brand across all platforms.<br><strong>日本語</strong>
