description: Mix of Static Page and Web Survey App - JavaScript 
bodyText: <strong>Problem</strong><br>This was probably the hardest page to create, since I had to rely on the old HTML coding, which was simple landing page at first.<a href="https://oway.ifing-beauty.com/lp2">https://oway.ifing-beauty.com/lp2</a>There were few frustrations that I went through with this.<br><br><strong>ISSUES</strong><br>(1) Because the company and the stylist involved in making the site had no knowledge in PCs or how creating websites worked, I had hard time implementing agile or scrum, as well as what they really wanted, web app or web site. <br>(2) In relating to the abovementioned, I had to create a separate 'web-app', a survey page, to let the user find out what product to buy based on their problems.<br>(3) On a positive note, I gained so much skills on JavaScript, increasing my skills to create a page or an app strictly using JavaScript, manipulating both front and back-end.
