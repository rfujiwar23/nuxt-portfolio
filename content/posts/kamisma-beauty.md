description: App to reserve with top-notch stylists in Japan.
bodyText: <strong>GOAL</strong><br>To differentiate from using Hot Pepper Beauty and other Japanese reservation sites, as it also will be Available in English (post-COVID)<br><br><strong>The Process</strong><br>Japanese stylists are getting recognized internationally, and good handful of foreigners visit Japan to experience the service of the salon stylists.The user can search by stylists or the area, and if they are lucky, they will be able to find "one special reservation spot" from the availability of a stylist, who would likely to make it available through posting it on their instagram feed.<br><br><strong>Other Points</strong><br>The creation process wasn't much of an hassle, both UIUX or with coding. This project is the only project that was finished nearly a month before the initial set completion date, so we had a lot of time to go over usability issues or UI components. Overall, this is the product that I'm most proud of in partaking.
