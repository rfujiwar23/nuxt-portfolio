bodyText: <strong>ABOUT</strong><br>I served concurrently as the product owner, product manager, and lead developer for the Nature Strategy Reports e-commerce platform, built on Shopify. The initiative originated from a business need identified by the lead Customer Success Manager, enabling research scientists and institutional leaders to directly purchase in-depth strategic reports covering emerging scientific domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Green Energy, and Food Security (commercially available from 2024 onward). Each report is delivered as a digital document (article/PDF) priced at €4,500 for EU customers and $4,500 for US customers.Because the offering is purely B2B, the buyers were predominantly universities, research institutes, and corporate R&D departments. <br>In its launch year (2024), the platform generated over €600K in EU sales and just under $900K in US sales. Despite the high unit price, the Shopify-based e-commerce channel performed exceptionally well, and I was able to make a direct, measurable contribution to revenue growth.<br>My role required extensive collaboration with both the international (European) and US-based finance and legal teams within Springer Nature, as well as with the commercial and sales teams in Nature Research Intelligence. I worked closely with them to understand - <br><br>◆ The differing legal entities and sales structures in each region.<br><br>◆ Tax rules and VAT/GST requirements per country.<br><br>◆ Compliance considerations for selling digital goods/e-documents globally<br><br>◆ How to align Shopify configurations with corporate accounting and reporting standards.<br>This cross-functional engagement ensured the platform met all regulatory requirements while providing a smooth purchasing experience for institutional clients across multiple markets.
