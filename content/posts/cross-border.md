description: First Web Design Project after getting Web Design Certificate
bodyText: <strong>ABOUT</strong><br>This is the website of my father's personal business, in which he has clients of both Japanese and American companies. This is only for PC view only, because most of the clients do not use smartphone that much in their work - they are office workers, so I designed the website in the PC view.<br><br><strong>The Process/Issues</strong><br>I received my web design certificate in December 2014.  However, I didn't have a full grasp of responsive design at this point, but it was a blessing as my father told me that most of his clients viewed mostly on PC - as they were older clients.
