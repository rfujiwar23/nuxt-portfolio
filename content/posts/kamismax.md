bodyText: <strong>My Role</strong><br<br><br><strong>My Role</strong><br>Rather than functioning strictly as a front-end developer, my primary contribution was as a UX/UI designer with hands-on front-end involvement. I led the UX direction of the platform, conducting deep user research and defining an experience tailored specifically to professional stylists. <br><br>I interviewed stylists directly to understand how an e-learning platform should feel for their industry. When I tested references like Udemy or Coursera, the feedback was consistent -  “too academic,” “too serious,” and “not engaging.” Many stylists join the industry right after high school, and traditional learning interfaces can feel intimidating or disconnected from how they prefer to consume content. To design a platform they would genuinely enjoy using, the UX needed to be closer to entertainment rather than education.<br><br>To achieve this, I analyzed design patterns from Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video—platforms stylists already interact with daily. Drawing from those insights, I designed a more cinematic, content-forward learning experience, built around visual storytelling, oversized thumbnails, and fluid, intuitive navigation. All UI/UX designs and interactive prototypes were created in Adobe XD, and I facilitated multiple review sessions with stylists to validate interaction patterns, layout hierarchy, and usability across several rounds of feedback.<br><br>Alongside the UX work, I partnered closely with the lead full-stack developer to ensure the experience translated cleanly into implementation. I provided detailed interaction specifications and front-end behavioral guidelines to support development. One feature we co-designed was a multi-camera switching interface for live streams, allowing learners to toggle between angles—crucial for capturing the detailed, close-up techniques stylists need to see but couldn’t access during COVID-era limitations.<br><br>Overall, my role blended UX strategy, UI craftsmanship, and front-end-minded collaboration to create an experience that felt engaging, modern, and tailored to the unique learning style of stylists.
