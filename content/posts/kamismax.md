description: An educational app for salon stylists
bodyText: <strong>Problem (What This App Solves)</strong><br>With the impact of COVID-19, hosting large, in-person seminars became nearly impossible—this was especially challenging for salon stylists, whose work relies heavily on observing techniques up close. Teaching haircut methods, color techniques, and hair-type–specific approaches traditionally requires physical proximity. The challenge was to create an app that could translate this highly visual and hands-on learning style into an effective digital format.<br><br><strong>日本語</strong><br>COVID-19 の影響により、多くの業界で大人数でのセミナーや講習会が困難になりました。特に美容業界では、スタイリストが技術を教える際に、髪質に応じたカット技法やカラーの手法などを「近距離で見る」ことが重要で、対面での学習が前提になっています。これをデジタル上で再現できる学習体験を実現することが、このアプリの大きな課題でした。<br><br><strong>My Role</strong><br>Rather than acting as a front-end developer, I contributed primarily as a UX/UI designer. My involvement centered on deep UX research and designing an experience tailored specifically for stylists.<br><br>I spoke directly with stylists to understand what an e-learning platform for their profession should look and feel like. When I showed them interfaces like Udemy, the feedback was consistent: “too educational,” “too formal,” and “not engaging.” Many stylists enter the field directly after high school, and traditional academic learning interfaces can feel discouraging or unrelatable. To create a platform they would actually want to use, the UX needed to feel closer to entertainment, not school.<br><br>This led me to study the design patterns and user experiences of Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video—platforms stylists already use daily to watch content casually. Drawing from those insights, I created a more cinematic, intuitive learning experience, focusing on visual storytelling, large thumbnails, and smooth navigation. All UI design and prototyping were done in Adobe XD, which I used to run multiple review sessions with stylists across several meetings.<br><br>In addition to defining the UX and UI, I collaborated closely with the lead full-stack developer to ensure technical feasibility. One key feature we introduced was the ability for learners to switch between multiple camera angles during a live stream, allowing them to clearly observe a stylist’s technique while they explain it—something especially important for replicating the “close-up learning” lost during COVID-era restrictions.
