bodyText: <strong>Problem (What This App Accomplishes)</strong><br>Because of COVID-19, having a seminar of session with many people is difficult in many fields, including stylists.<br>So, an option to have educational session is by web, but.. there is one issue, many stylists in Japan lack skills in using PCs, so it is important to create it mobile friendly, and also give it a feel of an app that's most common (Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime).<br><br><strong>The Process</strong><br>I researched the usability of Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, in addition to the non-work related activity of the salon stylists, as I actually took a few surveys to get a glimpse and find similar patterns.We've also found out that the stylists would want an upclose view of the haircut/styling, so being able to switch views woul be important.
