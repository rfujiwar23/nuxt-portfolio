description: Design through Photoshop Only.
bodyText: <strong>Description:</strong><br>I started my professional career as an assitant director at Tokyo TV Land, where I gained experience of creating videos through e-commerce sites. <br>I have been using Photoshop since my junior high school years, and was already a 10 year "veteran" of the Photoshop - I was creating posters used on sets for the products that were introduced on the programs.<br>I was asked to use my photoshop skills in creating a website, which was used by the e-commerce section of the company to code. This design was created before the mobile design was used, so this page was best viewed on PCs.
