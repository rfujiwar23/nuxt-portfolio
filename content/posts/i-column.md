description: A blog site in using the headless CMS
bodyText: <strong>GOAL</strong><br>To increase the SEO of IFING BEAUTY website, through articles posted on a blog site and persuade customers to buying the products.<br><br><strong>The Process</strong><br>This project is unique in the way that I did everything on my own, designing and also coding with Nuxt.js, in using the headless CMS site. It took about three weeks in learning and getting used to Nuxt.js.<br><br><strong>Other Points</strong><br>I've had experience in creating services with Vue.js so I decided to take further in challenging with creating a web site with Nuxt.js and using headless CMS. This is also my proud project because now, non-engineers can upload the blog post and I could only worry about the management of the website. Also, when a blog is posted into the micro-CMS, it also posts in the blog website in another pages, <a href="http://products.intense-z.com/" class="inner-link text-blue">http://products.intense-z.com/</a> and <a href="https://ifing-beauty.com/contents/column"><span class="inner-link text-blue">https://ifing-beauty.com/contents/column</span></a>
