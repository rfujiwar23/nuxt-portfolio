title: INVADE - Web Design/PHP 
description: Creating the website using an already used php file that was used to create the original page, in which I had to use to create the website.
bodyText: <strong>Points</strong><br>This project was a blend of hands-on web design and practical coding across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Although the site wasn’t built on WordPress, I implemented PHP-based text replacement to seamlessly switch between English and Japanese. This allowed the entire page content to toggle languages with a single button—an important feature given the company's global ambitions. Despite having used PHP previously within WordPress environments, this project required me to work with pure PHP, which significantly strengthened my understanding of PHP logic and file-based templating.<br>The website was created when INVADE Co., Ltd. was founded as a new company under INTENSE (alongside IFING). While the FTP server already contained initial PHP files, they had been untouched for some time. I took ownership from that starting point—designing the entire site structure, creating wireframes, and building out the front end from scratch.<br>In addition to the design and layout work, I implemented JavaScript functions to fetch data from a headless CMS API in order to dynamically populate the News section. This allowed the company to update content efficiently without modifying the codebase. Also, in implementing reCaptcha, it could mitigate the amount of spambots and mails.<br><br><br>For this project, I collaborated directly with the CEO to translate his vision of establishing INVADE as a globally recognized brand. This informed both the English-first approach of the layout and the clean, modern aesthetic. The multilingual support, UI decisions, and technical implementation all worked together to express the company’s international direction.<br>Overall, the project allowed me to combine full front-end development, UI design, and PHP integration, making it one of the most hands-on web design builds I completed for the organization.<br><br>【日本語】<br>.
