        <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h4>
      In high school, I was playing the piano in school jazz bands for all four years.
      It was broadcasted live on TV initially, but it eventually went to be broadcasted live on internet,
      when ADSL was still a hot commodity, so it was on a 45 second delay, when viewing on Internet.
      And I've been wanting to create online video platform ever since.<br> 
      I started my professional career as an Assistant Director, creating broadcast videos,
       with my strengths in creating home-shopping videos.  I initially started out on gaining experience on creating promotional
       videos on e-commerce and other in-store videos, and eventually got the opportunity to direct 
       the in-studio programming, of one project being a turning point in directing the programming 
       for the first time.  <br>Even though I changed jobs in my career,
       creating videos have come with me, being able to utilize my skills as an editor and overall visual storyteller.
       In my recent job, I've been working as a developer and a web video creator (as well as commercials and a short programming on FUJI TV).
       If I can utilize my video skills for you, great! <br>
       It might be a cherry on top if I can do this on top of being a developer.
